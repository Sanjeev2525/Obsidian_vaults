# Machine learning
*A field of study that gives computer capability to learn without being explicitly programmed*

## why we need machine learning ?
1. Human expertise does not exist
2. Humans can't explore the expertise
3. Model must be customized
4. Model based on huge amount of data

## Successful application of ml

#### Speech recognition
- Outperform all other approaches that have been attempted to date

#### Data mining
- Learning algorithms being used to discover valuable knowledge from large commercial databases
- Detect fraudulent use of credit cards

#### Play Games
•Play backgammon at levels approaching the performance of human world champions.

# LEARNING PROGRAMS 

## DEFENITION 
A computer program is said to learn from experience E with respect to some class of tasks T and performance measure P, if its performance at tasks in T, as measured by P, improves with experience E.


### Examples:

#### A checkers learning problem:
Task T: Playing checkers
Performance measure P: Percent of games won against opponents
Training experience E: Playing practice games against itself

#### Handwriting recognition learning problem:
Task T: Recognizing and classifying handwritten words within images
Performance measure P: Percent of words correctly classified
Training experience E: A database of handwritten words with given classifications

### Types of learning :

#### 1. Supervised learning(pending)
#### 2. Unsupervised learning(pending)
#### 3. Reinforcement learning(pending)
