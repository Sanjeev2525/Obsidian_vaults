# Perspective 

One useful perspective on machine learning is that it involves searching a very large space of possible hypotheses to determine one that best fits the observed data and any prior knowledge held by the learner

# Issues 

- What algorithms exist for learning general target functions from specific training examples? In what settings will particular algorithms converge to the desired function, given sufficient training data? Which algorithms perform best for which types of problems and representations?

- How much training data is needed to achieve a level of ‘confidence’ to the learned hypothesis? Are there any theoretical and general bounds?

- Can prior knowledge be useful during training, even when approximate?

- How should we chose the training experiences? What is the relationship between the strategy and the complexity of the learning problem.

- Is it possible to make automatic the process of picking target functions for learning?

- Is it possible to have a system that doesn’t have a fixed hypothesis representation but keeps changing it in response to the performance?
