# Perspective 

One useful perspective on machine learning is that it involves searching a very large space of possible hypotheses to determine one that best fits the observed data and any prior knowledge held by the learner

# Issues 

- <font style="color:cornflowerblue">What algorithms exist</font> for learning <u><font style="color:lightgreen">general target functions</font></u> from specific training examples? In <font style="color:cornflowerblue">what settings</font> will particular algorithms <font style="color:lightgreen">converge to the desired function</font>, given sufficient training data? <font style="color:cornflowerblue">Which algorithms</font> perform best for <font style="color:#C12869">which types of problems and representations</font>?

- <font style="color:cornflowerblue">How much training data is needed</font> to achieve a level of ‘confidence’ to the learned hypothesis? Are there any theoretical and general bounds?

- Can <font style="color:coral">prior knowledge</font> be useful during training, even when approximate?

- <font style="color:cornflowerblue">How should we chose the training experiences?</font> What is the relationship between the <font style="color:lightgreen">strategy and the complexity</font> of the learning problem.

- Is it possible to   <font style="color:pink">automate the process of picking target functions</font> for learning?

- Is it possible to have a system that <font style="color:pink">doesn’t have a fixed hypothesis representation</font> but keeps changing it in response to the performance?
