#### 1.Software engineering :
Systematic, <font style="color:cornflowerblue">disciplined</font>, <font style="color:coral">quantifiable</font> approach to the development, operation, and maintenance of software; that is, the application of engineering to software.  (2) The study of approaches as in (1).

#### 2.Requirement Engineering :
The process to <font style="color:cornflowerblue">gather the software requirements</font> from client, <font style="color:coral">analyze</font> and <font style="color:coral">document</font> them is known as requirement engineering.

The goal of requirement engineering is to develop and maintain sophisticated and descriptive <font style="color:#F2BB66">‘System Requirements Specification’</font> document.

##### Requirement Engineering Process

It is a four step process, which includes –
Feasibility Study
Requirement Gathering
Software Requirement Specification
Software Requirement Validation

![[Pasted image 20220919180749.png]]

###### (a)Feasibility study

When the client approaches the organization for getting the desired product developed, it comes up with rough idea about what all functions the software must perform and which all features are expected from the software.  
  
Referencing to this information, the analysts does a detailed study about whether the desired system and its functionality are feasible to develop.  
  
This feasibility study is focused towards goal of the organization. This study analyzes whether the software product can be practically materialized in terms of implementation, contribution of project to organization, cost constraints and as per values and objectives of the organization.  
  
 It explores technical aspects of the project and product such as usability, maintainability, productivity and integration ability.  
  
The output of this phase should be a feasibility study report that should contain adequate comments and recommendations for management about whether or not the project should be undertaken.

###### (b)Requirement gathering:

If the feasibility report is positive towards undertaking the project, next phase starts with gathering requirements from the user. Analysts and engineers communicate with the client and end-users to know their ideas on what the software should provide and which features they want the software to include.

###### (c)Software Requirement Specification  
  
SRS is a document created by system analyst after the requirements are collected from various stakeholders. SRS defines how the intended software will interact with hardware, external interfaces, speed of operation, response time of system, portability of software across various platforms, maintainability, speed of recovery after crashing, Security, Quality, Limitations etc.

The requirements received from client are written in natural language. It is the responsibility of system analyst to document the requirements in technical language so that they can be comprehended and useful by the software development team.

***SRS should come up with following features:***

 User Requirements are expressed in natural language.
 Technical requirements are expressed in structured language, which 
   is used inside the organization.
 Design description should be written in Pseudo code.
 Format of Forms and GUI screen prints.
 Conditional and mathematical notations for DFDs etc.


###### (d)Software Requirement Validation

After requirement specifications are developed, the requirements mentioned in this document are validated. User might ask for illegal, impractical solution or experts may interpret the requirements incorrectly. This results in huge increase in cost if not nipped in the bud.

Requirements can be checked against following conditions -

If they can be practically implemented
If they are valid and as per functionality and domain of software
If there are any ambiguities
If they are complete
If they can be demonstrated

#### 4. The 12 Principles of Agile Software

1. Our highest priority is to <font style="color:lightblue">satisfy the customer</font> through <font style="color:cornflowerblue">early</font> and <font style="color:cornflowerblue">continuous</font> delivery of valuable software.

2. <font style="color:cornflowerblue">Businesspeople</font> and <font style="color:cornflowerblue">developers </font>must <font style="color:khaki">work together</font> daily throughout the project.

3. The most efficient and <font style="color:cornflowerblue">effective method</font> of <font style="color:cornflowerblue">conveying information</font> to and within a development team is <font style="color:khaki">face-to-face conversation</font>

4. <font style="color:cornflowerblue">Build projects around motivated individuals.</font> Give them the environment and support they need, and trust them to get the job done

5. The best architectures, requirements, and designs emerge from <font style="color:cornflowerblue">self-organizing teams.</font>

6. At <font style="color:cornflowerblue">regular intervals</font>, the team reflects on <font style="color:pink">how to become more effective</font>, then tunes and adjusts its behavior accordingly.

7. <font style="color:cornflowerblue">Working software</font> is the <font style="color:#C12869">primary measure</font> of progress

8. <font style="color:#C12869">Simplicity</font>—the art of maximizing the amount of work not done—is essential.

9. Continuous <font style="color:cornflowerblue">attention to</font>  <font style="color:#C12869">technical excellence </font>and <font style="color:#C12869">good design</font> enhances agility.

10. <font style="color:cornflowerblue">Deliver</font> working software <font style="color:coral">frequently</font>, from a couple of weeks to a couple of months, with a preference to the shorter timescale.

11. Welcome <font style="color:coral">changing requirements</font>, even late in development. Agile processes harness change for the customer’s competitive advantage.

12. Agile processes <font style="color:#C12869">promote sustainable development</font>. The sponsors, developers, and users should be able to maintain a constant pace indefinitely.

#### 5.Scrum 

##### Scrum roles :
- <font style="color:cornflowerblue">The Product Owner</font> is responsible for the work the team is supposed to complete. The main role of a product owner is to <font style="color:#C12869">motivate the team</font> to achieve the goal and the vision of the project. While a project owner can take input from others but when it comes to making major decisions, ultimately he/she is responsible.

- <font style="color:cornflowerblue">The Scrum Master</font> ensures that all the team members <font style="color:#C12869">follow scrum’s theories, rules, and practices</font>. They make sure the Scrum Team has whatever it needs to complete its work, like removing roadblocks that are holding up progress, organizing meetings, dealing with challenges and bottlenecks

- <font style="color:cornflowerblue">The Development Team(Scrum Team)</font> is a self-organizing and a cross-functional team, <font style="color:#C12869">working together</font> to deliver products. Scrum development teams are given the freedom to organize themselves and manage their own work to maximize the team’s effectiveness and efficiency.

##### Values:
In Agile Project Management with Scrum , KenSchwaber discusses the five Scrum values: 
- Courage : Members must have courage to do the right thing.
- Commitment : Each person is committed to the project’s goals
- Respect : Respect each other to be independent and capable
- Focus : Everyone is focused on the work
- Openness :Team and stakeholders are open about work and challenges.

##### Sprint , S-Planning, S-backlog.
The software is built using <font style="color:cornflowerblue">time boxed iterations</font> called sprints. At the start of each sprint, the team does sprint planning to determine which features from the backlog they will build. This is called the sprint backlog.

##### Sprint retrospective:
![[Pasted image 20220919205429.png]]

##### User story

![[Pasted image 20220919205328.png]]
- User Stories also give teams an easy way to manage their backlogs
- User Story is simple and written from the user’s perspective, it’s easy for the Product Owner to review the stories with the users and Stakeholders – to figure out which stories are valuables
- Each Story is small, which make it easier to add new ones or change their order at any time 
- To Start the sprint – Product owner and team can pull of the stories out of the backlog and designate them to be delivered in this sprint
- The team can discuss the stories with the Product Owner and get the clarity 
- Most team will then break down the stories into task and start to estimate how long those tasks will take 
- The task for each story would go into the “To Do” Column of the task board 
- Once the team member taken the task it moved to “In Progress” Column of the task board

##### Burndown chart
- It is a visual representation of remaining amount of work for any specific sprint at Scrum team level.
- A burndown chart is a way for anyone to see, at a glance, how the sprint is actually progressing when compared with the team’s past velocity.

#### 6.Kanban :
![[Pasted image 20220919205735.png]]

##### Values:
- Transparency: By an open exchange of information and a clear and 
                         unambiguous vocabulary you create transparency in all areas.  
- Balance : You are efficient if you balance the different requirements 
                  ,views and abilities of all participants among each other. 
- Collaboration : The Kanban method improves the way people work 
                           together. Collaboration is therefore one of its key points. 
- Customer Focus : The customers and the value (asset) they receive 
                                are the natural Centre of interest of all persons involved in the company

##### Principle :

• Start with what you do now
• Agree to pursue incremental, evolutionary change
• Initially, respect current roles, responsibilities & job titles

##### Practices :

• Visualize
• Limit WIP
• Manage Flow
• Make Process Policies Explicit
• Implement Feedback Loops
• Improve Collaboratively, Evolve Experimentally (using models/scientific method)

#### 7. Validation and Verification

![[Pasted image 20220919201327.png]]

---
#### 8.Agile
- Agile is a <font style="color:cornflowerblue">set of methods and methodologies</font> that help your team to think more effectively, work more efficiently, and make better decisions. 

- These methods and methodologies <font style="color:cornflowerblue">address all of the areas of traditional software engineering</font>, including project management, software design and architecture, and process improvement. 

- Agile is also a <font style="color:cornflowerblue">mindset</font>, because the right mindset can make a big difference in how effectively a team uses the practices

##### Values :
![[Pasted image 20220919215123.png]]

##### Agile Umbrella
The word agile is an umbrella term that refers to **the methodologies which engage in an iterative process**
![[Pasted image 20220919203503.png]]

#### 9.Little's Law :
A theorem that’s part of queueing theory

`L = W× λ`

λ= Arrival rate 
L= Inventory 
W= Average Lead time

This means that if you have a stable workflow, the average inventory is always equal to the average arrival rate multiplied by the average lead time.

If the office staff schedules 11 patients to arrive every hour (so the arrival rate λ is 11/hour),
and the office has average inventory of seven patients over the course of the day (so the inventory L is 7),

then Little’s Law tells us the average time patients have to wait: 

W = L ÷ λ = 7 patients ÷ (11 per hour) =.63hours=37 minutes.

#### 10.Kanban vs Scrum

![[Pasted image 20220919210903.png]]

#### 11.Process model

##### Waterfall model
![[Pasted image 20220919221416.png]]

![[Pasted image 20220919221505.png]]
![[Pasted image 20220919221522.png]]

##### V-Model :
![[Pasted image 20220919221646.png]]

- Variation of Waterfall model
- It is also known as Verification and validation model
- Based on the association of testing phase for each development stage

- Verification refers to the review activities or static testing methods

  Are we building the product right?

- Validation refers to the actual test execution activities or dynamic testing approaches 

    Are we building the right product?

![[Pasted image 20220919221826.png]]

##### Incremental Model :
- Incremental Model is a process of software development where requirements are broken down into multiple standalone modules of software development cycle. 
- Incremental development is done in steps from analysis , design , implementation, testing/verification, and maintenance.

![[Pasted image 20220919222032.png]]

##### Evolutionary model
-  It is a combination of iterative and incremental approach for developing a good software.
- 
	1. Prototyping Model
	2. Spiral Model
	3. Concurrent Development Model

###### Prototyping model :

- Mockup or model (throw away version) of a software product.
- Used when customer defines a set of objectives but does not identify input, output or processing requirement

Developer is not sure of:
 - efficiency of an algorithm
 - adaptability of an operating system
 - human/machine interaction

![[Pasted image 20220919222945.png]]

Advantages :

- Prototype model need not know the detailed input, output, processes, adaptability of operating system and full machine interaction.
- In the development process of this model users are actively involved.
- The development process is the best platform to understand the system by the user.
- Errors are detected much earlier.
- Gives quick user feedback for better solutions.
- It identifies the missing functionality easily. It also identifies the confusing or difficult functions.

Disadvantages :
- In a rush to get it working , overall software quality or long term maintainability are generally overlooked
- Use of inappropriate PL or OS
- Use of inefficient Algorithm

###### Spiral model 
![[Pasted image 20220919223223.png]]
![[Pasted image 20220919223238.png]]

- Communication – Gather Requirements from Customers 
- Planning – Plan to be followed will be created. It describes the technical task to be conducted, risk ,required resources, work schedule etc., 
- Modeling – A model will be created to better understand the requirements 
- Construction – Code generated and tested
- Deployment - Complete or partial complete version of software is given to the customer to evaluate and they give feed back based on the evaluation
