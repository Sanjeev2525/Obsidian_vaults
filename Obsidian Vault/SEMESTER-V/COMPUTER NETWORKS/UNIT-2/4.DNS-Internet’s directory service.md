# DNS—The Internet’s Directory Service

There are two ways to identify a host
- Hostname- Human readable form.
- IP address - (32 bit) - used for addressing datagrams.

`Q: how to map between IP address and name, and vice versa ?`

## Services Provided by DNS

- <font style="color:coral">Distributed database</font> implemented in hierarchy of DNS servers.

- <font style="color:coral"> Application-layer protocol:</font> 
	- Hosts, 
	- Translate user-supplied hostnames to IP addresses

- Note: Core Internet function, implemented as application-layer protocol
- The DNS servers are often UNIX machines running the Berkeley Internet Name Domain (BIND) software [BIND 2020]. The DNS protocol runs over UDP and uses port 53.
- Complexity at network’s “edge”

<font style="color:#F2BB66">DNS provides a few other important services in addition to translating hostnames to IP addresses:</font>

1. <font style="color:#F2BB66">Host aliasing :</font> A host with a complicated hostname can have one or more alias names. For example, a hostname such as relay1.west-coast .enterprise.com could have, say, two aliases such as enterprise.com and www.enterprise.com. In this case, the hostname relay1 .west-coast.enterprise.com is said to be a <font style="color:#C12869">canonical hostname</font>
2. <font style="color:#F2BB66">Mail server aliasing :</font> The MX record (see below) permits a company’s mail server and Web server to have identical (aliased) hostnames; for example, a company’s Web server and mail server can both be called enterprise.com.
3. <font style="color:#F2BB66">Load distribution:</font> 
	- DNS is also used to perform load distribution among replicated servers, such as replicated Web servers . For replicated Web servers, a set of IP addresses is thus associated with one alias hostname. 
	- The DNS database contains this set of IP addresses. When clients make a DNS query for a name mapped to a set of addresses, the server responds with the entire set of IP addresses, but rotates the ordering of the addresses within each reply. Because a client typically sends its HTTP request message to the IP address that is listed first in the set, DNS rotation distributes the traffic among the replicated servers. DNS rotation is also used for e-mail so that multiple mail servers can have the same alias name. Also, content distribution companies such as Akamai

<font style="color:#C12869">Why not centralize DNS?</font>

- Single point of failure
- Traffic volume
- Distant centralized database
- Maintenance
- Doesn‘t scale!

## A Distributed, Hierarchical Database

<font style="color:coral">Root DNS servers:</font> 
- There are more than 1000 root servers instances scattered all over the world. These root servers are copies of 13 different root servers, managed by 12 different organizations, and coordinated through the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority 
- Root name servers provide the IP addresses of the TLD servers.

<font style="color:coral">Top-level domain (TLD) servers :</font> 
- For each of the top-level domains—top-level domains such as com, org, net, edu, and gov, and all of the country top-level domains such as uk, fr, ca, and jp— there is TLD server (or server cluster).

<font style="color:coral">Authoritative DNS servers :</font> 
- Every organization with publicly accessible hosts (such as Web servers and mail servers) on the Internet must provide publicly accessible DNS records that map the names of those hosts to IP addresses. An organization’s authoritative DNS server houses these DNS records. An organization can choose to implement its own authoritative DNS server to hold these records; alternatively, the organization can pay to have these records stored in an authoritative DNS server of some service provider. Most universities and large companies implement and maintain their own primary and secondary (backup) authoritative DNS server.

There is another important type of DNS server called the 
<font style="color:coral">"local DNS server"</font>  which will be discussed more in chapter 4
