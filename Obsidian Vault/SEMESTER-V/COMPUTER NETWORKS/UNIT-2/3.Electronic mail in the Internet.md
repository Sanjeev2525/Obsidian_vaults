# E-mail
E-mail is an asynchronous communication medium—people send and read messages when it is convenient for them.

<font style="color:violet">Three major components:</font>

- <font style="color:coral">User agents :</font> a.k.a. “mail reader” 
- <font style="color:coral">Mail servers : </font>
	- <font style="color:LIGHTGREEN">Mailbox</font> contains incoming messages for user
	- <font style="color:lightGREEN">Message queue</font> of outgoing (to be sent) mail messages
	- <font style="color:lightGREEN">SMTP</font> protocol between mail servers to send email messages
		- client: sending mail server
		- server: receiving mail server
- <font style="color:coral">Simple mail transfer protocol</font>: SMT

## THE RFC (Request for comments):

<font style="color:crimson">RFC (stands for Request For Comments)</font> is a document that describes the standards, protocols, and technologies of the Internet and TCP/IP.

- Uses TCP to reliably transfer email message from client (mail server initiating connection) to server, port 25
- Direct transfer: sending server (acting like client) to receiving server
- Three phases of transfer
	- Handshaking (greeting)
	- Transfer of messages
	- Closure
- Command/response interaction (like HTTP)
	- Commands: ASCII text
	- Response: status code and phrase
- Messages must be in 7-bit ASCI

## Scenario

![[Pasted image 20220911214055.png]]

 1. Alice uses UA to compose e-mail message “to” bob@someschool.edu
 2. Alice’s UA sends message to her mail server; message placed in message queue
 3. Client side of SMTP opens TCP connection with Bob’s mail server
 4. SMTP client sends Alice’s message over the TCP connection.
 5. Bob’s mail server places the message in Bob’s mailbox
 6. Bob invokes his user agent to read message

<font style="color:lightblue">Why the two-step procedure?</font>

Primarily because without relaying through Alice’s mail server, Alice’s user agent doesn’t have any recourse to an unreachable destination mail server. By having Alice first deposit the e-mail in her own mail server, Alice’s mail server can repeatedly try to send the message to Bob’s mail server, say every 30 minutes, until Bob’s mail server becomes operational.

<font style="color:lightblue">How does a recipient like Bob, running a user agent on his local host , obtain his messages, which are sitting in a mail server?</font>

Note that Bob’s user agent can’t use SMTP to obtain the messages because obtaining the messages is a pull operation, whereas SMTP is a push protocol.

Today, there are two common ways for Bob to retrieve his e-mail from a mail server. 

1. If Bob is using Web-based e-mail or a smartphone app (such as Gmail), then the user agent will use HTTP to retrieve Bob’s e-mail. This case requires Bob’s mail server to have an HTTP interface as well as an SMTP interface (to communicate with Alice’s mail server). 
2. The alternative method, typically used with mail clients such as Microsoft Outlook, is to use the <font style="color:lime">Internet Mail Access Protocol (IMAP)</font> defined in RFC 3501. Both the HTTP and IMAP approaches allow Bob to manage folders, maintained in Bob’s mail server. Bob can move messages into the folders he creates, delete messages, mark messages as important, and so on.

# SMTP: closing observations

- Comparison with HTTP:
	- HTTP: pull
	- SMTP: push

- Both have ASCII command/response interaction, status codes
- HTTP: each object encapsulated in its own response message
- SMTP: multiple objects sent in multipart message
- SMTP uses persistent connections
- SMTP requires message (header & body) to be in 7-bit ASCII
- SMTP server uses CRLF(CRLF to determine end of message)
