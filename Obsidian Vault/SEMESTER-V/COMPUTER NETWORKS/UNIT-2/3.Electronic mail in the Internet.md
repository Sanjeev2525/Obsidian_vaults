# E-mail
E-mail is an asynchronous communication medium—people send and read messages when it is convenient for them.

<font style="color:violet">Three major components:</font>

- <font style="color:coral">User agents :</font> a.k.a. “mail reader” 
- <font style="color:coral">Mail servers : </font>
	- <font style="color:LIGHTGREEN">Mailbox</font> contains incoming messages for user
	- <font style="color:lightGREEN">Message queue</font> of outgoing (to be sent) mail messages
	- <font style="color:lightGREEN">SMTP</font> protocol between mail servers to send email messages
		- client: sending mail server
		- server: receiving mail server
- <font style="color:coral">Simple mail transfer protocol</font>: SMT

## THE RFC (Request for comments):

<font style="color:crimson">RFC (stands for Request For Comments)</font> is a document that describes the standards, protocols, and technologies of the Internet and TCP/IP.

- Uses TCP to reliably transfer email message from client (mail server initiating connection) to server, port 25
- Direct transfer: sending server (acting like client) to receiving server
- Three phases of transfer
	- Handshaking (greeting)
	- Transfer of messages
	- Closure
- Command/response interaction (like HTTP)
	- Commands: ASCII text
	- Response: status code and phrase
- Messages must be in 7-bit ASCI
