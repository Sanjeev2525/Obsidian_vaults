# CLIENT-SERVER PARADIGM:

<font style="color:cornflowerblue">Server:</font>

- Always-on host
- Permanent IP address
- often in data centers  for scaling.

<font style="color:cornflowerblue">Clients:</font>

- Contact, communicate with server
- May be intermittently connected
- May have dynamic IP addresses
- Do not communicate directly with each other
- examples: HTTP, IMAP, FTP

# Peer-peer architecture

- No always-on server
- Arbitrary end systems directly communicate
- Peers request service from other peers, provide service in return to other peers
- Self scalability – new peers bring new service capacity, as well as new service demands
- Peers are intermittently connected and change IP addresses
- Complex management
- Example: P2P file sharing

<font style="color:lightblue">Process:</font> program running within a host within same host, two processes communicate using  inter-process communication (defined by OS) processes in different hosts communicate by exchanging messages.

![[Pasted image 20220909192455.png]]
Note:  Applications with P2P architectures have client processes & server processes

---
# Sockets:

![[Pasted image 20220911164901.png]]

- Process sends/receives messages to/from its socket
- Socket analogous to door
	- Sending process shoves message out door
	- Sending process relies on transport infrastructure on other side of door to deliver message to socket at receiving process
	- Two sockets involved: one on each side
---
# Addressing process :

- To receive messages, process  must have identifier , host device has unique 32-bit IP address.

	`Q: does  IP address of host on which process runs suffice for identifying the process?`
	
	`A: no, many processes can be running on same host`

- Identifier includes both IP address and port numbers associated with process on host.

- Example port numbers:
	- HTTP server: 80
	- mail server: 25

- To send HTTP message to gaia.cs.umass.edu web server:
	- IP address: 128.119.245.12
	- Port number: 80

<font style="color:coral"> An application-layer protocol defines: </font>

- Types of messages exchanged 
   e.g., request, response
- Message syntax:
	What fields in messages & how fields are delineated
- Message semantics
	Meaning of information in fields
	Rules for when and how processes send & respond to messages.
- Open protocols:
	Defined in RFCs, everyone has access to protocol definition allows for interoperability.
	e.g., HTTP, SMTP
- Proprietary protocols:
	e.g., Skype

<font style="color:#98AFC7">What transport service does an app need?</font>

<font style="color:#7DFDFE">Data integrity :</font>
- Some apps (e.g., file transfer, web transactions) require 100% reliable data transfer
- Other apps (e.g., audio) can tolerate some loss

<font style="color:#7DFDFE">Timing :</font>
- Some apps (e.g., Internet telephony, interactive games) require low delay to be “effective

<font style="color:#7DFDFE">Throughput:</font>
- Some apps (e.g., multimedia) require minimum amount of throughput to be “effective”
- Other apps (“elastic apps”) make use of whatever throughput they get

<font style="color:#7DFDFE">Security :</font>
- encryption, data integrity

**SECURING TCP :**

- Neither TCP nor UDP provides any encryption—the data that the sending process passes into its socket is the same data that travels over the network to the destination process. 
- So, for example, if the sending process sends a password in cleartext (i.e., unencrypted) into its socket, the cleartext password will travel over all the links between sender and receiver, potentially getting sniffed and discovered at any of the intervening links. 
- Because privacy and other security issues have become critical for many applications, the Internet community has developed an enhancement for TCP, called <font style="color:CRIMSON">Transport Layer Security(TLS) </font>.

 <font style="color:CRIMSON">Transport Layer Security(TLS) provides :</font> 
 
- Encrypted TCP connections
- Data integrity
- End-point authentication
- TSL implemented in application layer:
	- Apps use TSL libraries, that use TCP in turn

- TLS socket API:
	- Cleartext sent into socket  traverse Internet  encrypted
