**In this section :**

- Conceptual and implementation aspects of application-layer protocols.
- Transport-layer service models.
- Client-server paradigm.
- Peer-to-peer paradigm.
- Learn about protocols by examining popular application-layer protocols.
	HTTP.
	SMTP, IMAP.
	DNS.
- Programming network applications.
	Socket API.

<font style="color:coral"> An application-layer protocol defines: </font>

- Types of messages exchanged 
   e.g., request, response
- Message syntax:
	What fields in messages & how fields are delineated
- Message semantics
	Meaning of information in fields
	Rules for when and how processes send & respond to messages.
- Open protocols:
	Defined in RFCs, everyone has access to protocol definition allows for interoperability.
	e.g., HTTP, SMTP
- Proprietary protocols:
	e.g., Skype

**CLIENT-SERVER PARADIGM:**

<font style="color:cornflowerblue">Server:</font>

- Always-on host
- Permanent IP address
- often in data centers  for scaling.

<font style="color:cornflowerblue">Clients:</font>

- Contact, communicate with server
- May be intermittently connected
- May have dynamic IP addresses
- Do not communicate directly with each other
- examples: HTTP, IMAP, FTP

**Peer-peer architecture**

- No always-on server
- Arbitrary end systems directly communicate
- Peers request service from other peers, provide service in return to other peers
- Self scalability – new peers bring new service capacity, as well as new service demands
- Peers are intermittently connected and change IP addresses
- Complex management
- Example: P2P file sharing

<font style="color:lightblue">Process:</font> program running within a host within same host, two processes communicate using  inter-process communication (defined by OS) processes in different hosts communicate by exchanging messages.

Note:  Applications with P2P architectures have client processes & server processes
