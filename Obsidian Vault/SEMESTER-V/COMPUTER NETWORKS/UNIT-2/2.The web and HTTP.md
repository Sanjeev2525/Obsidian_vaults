**HTTP Overview:**

- <font style="color:coral">HTTP:</font> hypertext transfer protocol
	- Web’s application layer protocol
- Web page consists of objects, each of which can be stored on different Web servers
- Object can be HTML file, JPEG image, Java applet, audio file,…
- Web page consists of base HTML-file which includes several referenced objects, each addressable by a URL, e.g.,

www.someschool.edu/someDept/pic.gif
|       __host name       |    _pathname    |

- <font style="color:coral">Client/server model:</font>
	- Client: browser that requests, receives, (using HTTP protocol) and “displays” Web objects
	 - Server: Web server sends (using HTTP protocol) objects in response to requests.

- <font style="color:coral">HTTP uses TCP:</font>
	- Client initiates TCP connection (creates socket) to server,  port 80
	- Server accepts TCP connection from client
	- HTTP messages (application-layer protocol messages) exchanged between browser (HTTP client) and Web server (HTTP server)
	- TCP connection closed

- <font style="color:coral">HTTP is “stateless”</font>
	- Server maintains no information about past client request

- <font style="color:coral">HTTP connections: two types</font>
	- <font style="color:khaki">Non-persistent HTTP</font>
		1. TCP connection opened
		2. at most one object sent over TCP connection
		3. TCP connection closed
		4. downloading multiple objects required multiple connections
	
	- <font style="color:khaki">Persistent HTTP</font>
		1. TCP connection opened to a server
		2. Multiple objects can be sent over single TCP connection between client, and that server
		3. TCP connection closed

**Non-persistent HTTP :** 

- <font style="color:pink">Response time:</font>
	
	- <font style="color:coral">RTT(Round trip time):</font> Time for a small packet to travel from client to server and back.

	- <font style="color:coral">HTTP response time (per object):</font>
		- One RTT to initiate TCP connection
		- One RTT for HTTP request and first few bytes of HTTP response to return object/file transmission time.
		- Non-persistent HTTP response time =  2RTT+ file transmission  time

- <font style="color:pink">Issues:</font>
	- A brand new connections must be established and maintained for each required object.
		For each of these connections,
		- TCP buffers must be allocated
		- TCP variables must be kept in both client and server.
	- Requires 2 RTTs per object
	- OS overhead for each TCP connection
	- Browsers often open multiple parallel TCP connections to fetch referenced objects in parallel.

**Persistent connection :**

- Server leaves TCP connection open after sending response
- Subsequent HTTP messages  between same client/server sent over open connection
- Client sends requests as soon as it encounters a referenced object
- As little as one RTT for all the referenced objects (cutting response time in half)
- In particular, an entire Web page (in the example above, the base HTML file and the 10 images) can be sent over a single persistent TCP connection.
- Moreover, multiple Web pages residing on the same server can be sent from the server to the same client over a single persistent TCP connection.
- These requests for objects can be made back-to-back, without waiting for replies to pending requests (pipelining).

**HTTP Message Format :**

**Two types of HTTP messages: 
- Request, 
- Response

**REQUEST MESSAGE:**

<font style="color:pink">HTTP request message:</font> ASCII (human-readable format)

![[Pasted image 20220909213118.png]]

<font style="color:pink">HTTP request message:</font> general format

![[Pasted image 20220909213928.png]]

<font style="color:PINK">Other HTTP request messages</font>

<font style="color:coral">POST method:</font>
	- Web page often includes form input
	- User input sent from client to server in entity body of HTTP POST request message.

<font style="color:coral">GET method (for sending data to server):</font>
	- Include user data in URL field of HTTP GET request message (following a ‘?’):
<font style="color:coral">HEAD method:</font>
	- Requests headers (only) that would be returned if specified URL were requested  with an HTTP GET method

<font style="color:coral">PUT method:</font>
	- Uploads new file (object) to server
	- Completely replaces file that exists at specified URL with content in entity body of POST HTTP request message.

**HTTP response message :**

![[Pasted image 20220909222803.png]]

<font style="color:yellow">HTTP response status code:</font>

| 200 OK | request succeeded          | requested object later in this message                                                        |
| ------ | -------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 301    | Moved permanently          | requested object moved to a new location specified later in this message (in Location: field) |
| 400    | Bad Request                | request msg not understood by server                                                          |
| 404    | Not Found                  | requested document not found on this server                                                   |
| 505    | HTTP Version Not Supported | version not supported                                                                         |
