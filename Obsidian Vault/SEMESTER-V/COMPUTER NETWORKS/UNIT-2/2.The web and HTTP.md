# HTTP Overview:

- <font style="color:coral">HTTP:</font> hypertext transfer protocol
	- Web’s application layer protocol
- Web page consists of objects, each of which can be stored on different Web servers
- Object can be HTML file, JPEG image, Java applet, audio file,…
- Web page consists of base HTML-file which includes several referenced objects, each addressable by a URL, e.g.,

www.someschool.edu/someDept/pic.gif
|      host name         ()          pathname   | 

-  <font style="color:coral">Client/server model:</font>
	- Client: browser that requests, receives, (using HTTP protocol) and “displays” Web objects
	 - Server: Web server sends (using HTTP protocol) objects in response to requests.

- <font style="color:coral">HTTP uses TCP:</font>
	- Client initiates TCP connection (creates socket) to server,  port 80
	- Server accepts TCP connection from client
	- HTTP messages (application-layer protocol messages) exchanged between browser (HTTP client) and Web server (HTTP server)
	- TCP connection closed

- <font style="color:coral">HTTP is “stateless”</font>
	- Server maintains no information about past client request

- <font style="color:coral">HTTP connections: two types</font>
	- <font style="color:khaki">Non-persistent HTTP</font>
		1. TCP connection opened
		2. at most one object sent over TCP connection
		3. TCP connection closed
		4. downloading multiple objects required multiple connections
	
	- <font style="color:khaki">Persistent HTTP</font>
		1. TCP connection opened to a server
		2. Multiple objects can be sent over single TCP connection between client, and that server
		3. TCP connection closed

### Non-persistent HTTP :

- <font style="color:pink">Response time:</font>
	
	- <font style="color:coral">RTT(Round trip time):</font> Time for a small packet to travel from client to server and back.

		![[Pasted image 20220909202435.png]]

	- <font style="color:coral">HTTP response time (per object):</font>
		- One RTT to initiate TCP connection
		- One RTT for HTTP request and first few bytes of HTTP response to return object/file transmission time.
		- Non-persistent HTTP response time =  2RTT+ file transmission  time

- <font style="color:pink">Issues:</font>
	- A brand new connections must be established and maintained for each required object.
		For each of these connections,
		- TCP buffers must be allocated
		- TCP variables must be kept in both client and server.
	- Requires 2 RTTs per object
	- OS overhead for each TCP connection
	- Browsers often open multiple parallel TCP connections to fetch referenced objects in parallel.

### Persistent connection :

- Server leaves TCP connection open after sending response
- Subsequent HTTP messages  between same client/server sent over open connection
- Client sends requests as soon as it encounters a referenced object
- As little as one RTT for all the referenced objects (cutting response time in half)
- In particular, an entire Web page (in the example above, the base HTML file and the 10 images) can be sent over a single persistent TCP connection.
- Moreover, multiple Web pages residing on the same server can be sent from the server to the same client over a single persistent TCP connection.
- These requests for objects can be made back-to-back, without waiting for replies to pending requests (pipelining).

# HTTP Message Format :

Two types of HTTP messages: 
- Request, 
- Response

## REQUEST MESSAGE:

<font style="color:pink">HTTP request message:</font> ASCII (human-readable format)

![[Pasted image 20220909213118.png]]

<font style="color:pink">HTTP request message:</font>  general format

![[Pasted image 20220909213928.png]]

<font style="color:PINK">Other HTTP request messages</font>

<font style="color:coral">POST method:</font>
	- Web page often includes form input
	- User input sent from client to server in entity body of HTTP POST request message.

<font style="color:coral">GET method (for sending data to server):</font>
	- Include user data in URL field of HTTP GET request message (following a ‘?’):
<font style="color:coral">HEAD method:</font>
	- Requests headers (only) that would be returned if specified URL were requested  with an HTTP GET method

<font style="color:coral">PUT method:</font>
	- Uploads new file (object) to server
	- Completely replaces file that exists at specified URL with content in entity body of POST HTTP request message.

## HTTP response message :

![[Pasted image 20220909222803.png]]

## HTTP response status code:

| 200 OK | request succeeded          | requested object later in this message                                                        |
| ------ | -------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 301    | Moved permanently          | requested object moved to a new location specified later in this message (in Location: field) |
| 400    | Bad Request                | request msg not understood by server                                                          |
| 404    | Not Found                  | requested document not found on this server                                                   |
| 505    | HTTP Version Not Supported | version not supported                                                                         |

# USER-SERVER INTERACTION : COOKIES

We mentioned above that an HTTP server is stateless. This simplifies server design and has permitted engineers to develop high performance Web servers that can handle thousands of simultaneous TCP connections. 

However, it is often desirable for a Web site to identify users, either because the server wishes to restrict user access or because it wants to serve content as a function of the user identity. For these purposes, HTTP uses <font style="color:LIME">cookies.</font>

Cookie technology has four components: 

1.  A cookie header line in the HTTP response message.
2.  A cookie header line in the HTTP request message.
3.  A cookie file kept on the user’s end system and managed by the user’s browser.
4.  A back-end database at the Web site.

![[Pasted image 20220911182216.png]]


**Observation from the Analogy :**
Browser consults her cookie file, extracts her identification number for this site, and puts a cookie header line that includes the identification number in the HTTP request. Specifically, each of her HTTP requests to the Amazon server includes the header line: Cookie: 1678

### Uses of cookies 
- Authorization
- Shopping carts
- Recommendations
- User session state (Web e-mail)


<font style="color:lightblue">Challenge: How to keep state:</font>

- Protocol endpoints: maintain state at sender/receiver over multiple transactions
- Cookies: HTTP messages carry state

<font style="color:lightblue">Cookies and privacy:</font>

- Cookies permit sites to learn a lot about you on their site.
- Third party persistent cookies (tracking cookies) allow common identity (cookie value) to be tracked across multiple web sites

# Web Caching :

A Web cache—also called a <font style="color:PINK">proxy server</font>—is a network entity that satisfies HTTP requests on the behalf of an origin Web server. The Web cache has its own disk storage and keeps copies of recently requested objects in this storage.


## STEPS INVOLVED :

1. The browser establishes a TCP connection to the Web cache and sends an HTTP request for the object to the Web cache.
2. The Web cache checks to see if it has a copy of the object stored locally. If it does, the Web cache returns the object within an HTTP response message to the client browser. 
3. If the Web cache does not have the object, the Web cache opens a TCP connection to the origin server, that is, to www.someschool.edu. The Web cache then sends an HTTP request for the object into the cache-to-server TCP connection. After receiving this request, the origin server sends the object within an HTTP response to the Web cache. 
4. When the Web cache receives the object, it stores a copy in its local storage and sends a copy, within an HTTP response message, to the client browser (over the existing TCP connection between the client browser and the Web cache).


![[Pasted image 20220911184349.png]]

User configures browser to point to a Web cache

- Browser sends all HTTP requests to cache
	- If object in cache: cache returns object to client
	- Else : cache requests object from origin server, caches received object, then returns object to client.
- Web cache acts as both client and server
	- server for original requesting client
	- client to origin server
- Typically cache is purchased and installed by ISP (university, company, residential ISP).


## Why Web caching?

- Reduce response time for client request
	i.e cache is closer to client
- Reduce traffic on an institution’s access link
- Internet is dense with caches
	- Enables “poor” content providers to more effectively deliver content.
