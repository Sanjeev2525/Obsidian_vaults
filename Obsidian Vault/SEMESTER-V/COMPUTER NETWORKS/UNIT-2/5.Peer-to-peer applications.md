# PENDING

- No always-on server
- Arbitrary end systems directly communicate
- Peers request service from other peers, provide service in return to other peers
	- Self scalability â€“ new peers bring new service capacity, and new service demands
- Peers are intermittently connected and change IP addresses
	- complex management

Examples: P2P file sharing (BitTorrent), streaming (KanKan), VoIP (Skype)
