**INTERNET :**
1. The Internet is a computer network that interconnects billions of computing devices throughout the world.

<font style="color:lightPINK"> NETWORK EDGE :</font>
2. In networking jargon, a computer, phone, or internet of things device connected to a computer network is sometimes referred to as <font style="color:lightblue">end system</font> because it sits at the edge of the network
3. 
-  Or otherwise known as <font style="color:lightblue">hosts</font> because they host (that is, run) application programs such as a Web browser program, a Web server program , an e-mail, client program, or an e-mail server program.
- Hosts are sometimes further divided into two categories: <font style="color:lightblue"> clients</font> and <font style="color:lightblue"> servers.</font> Informally, clients tend to be desktops, laptops, smartphones, and so on, whereas servers tend to be more powerful machines that store and distribute Web pages, stream video, relay e-mail, and so on.
- Today, most of the servers from which we receive search results, e-mail, Web pages, videos and mobile app content reside in large data centers. For example, as of 2020, Google has 19 data centers on four continents, collectively containing several million servers.

- End systems are connected together by a network of <font style="color:lightblue">communication links</font> and <font style="color:lightblue">Packet Switches</font>.
- There are many types of <font style="color:lightblue">communication links</font>, which are made up of different types of  **physical media, including coaxial cable, copper wire, optical fiber, and radio spectrum.**
- Different links can transmit data at different rates, with the transmission rate of a link measured in bits/second.
- When one end system has data to send to another end system, the sending end system segments the data and adds <font style="color:lightpink">header </font>bytes to each segment. The resulting packages of information, known as <font style="color:lightblue">Packets</font>.
- A packet switch takes a packet arriving on one of its incoming communication links and forwards that packet on one of its outgoing communication links. Packet switches come in many shapes and flavors, but the two most prominent types in today’s Internet are <font style="color:lightblue">link-layer switches</font> and  <font style="color:lightblue">routers.</font>
- The sequence of communication links and packet switches traversed by a packet from the sending end system to the receiving end system is known as a <font style="color:lightblue">Route</font> or <font style="color:lightblue">Path</font> through the network. Cisco predicts annual global IP traffic will reach nearly five zettabytes (1021 bytes) by 2022.

5. 
 - End sytems access the Internet through <font style="color:lightblue">Internet Service Providers (ISPs)</font>,  including residential ISPs such as local cable or telephone companies; corporate ISPs; university ISPs; ISPs that provide WiFi access in airports, hotels, coffee shops, and other public places; and cellular data ISPs, providing mobile access to our smartphones and other devices. Each ISP is in itself a network of packet switches and communication links.
 - These lower tier ISPs are thus interconnected through national and international upper-tier ISPs and these upper-tier ISPs are connected directly to each other. An upper-tier ISP consists of high-speed routers interconnected with high-speed fiber-optic links. Each ISP network, whether upper-tier or lower-tier, is managed independently, runs the IP protocol , and conforms to certain naming and address conventions.
 
6. End systems, packet switches, and other pieces of the Internet run protocols that control the sending and receiving of information within the Internet. The <font style="color:lightpink">Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)</font> and the <font style="color:lightblue">Internet Protocol (IP)</font> are two of the most important protocols in the Internet. The IP protocol specifies the format of the packets that are sent and received among routers and end systems. The Internet’s principal protocols are collectively known as <font style="color:lightblue">TCP/IP.</font> 

7. Given the importance of protocols to the Internet, it’s important that everyone agree on what each and every protocol does, so that people can create systems and products that interoperate. This is where standards come into play. Internet standards are developed by the <font style="color:lightblue">Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF)</font> [IETF 2020]. The IETF standards documents are called <font style="color:lightblue">requests for comments (RFCs).</font>

**SERVICE DISCRIPTION:**
Internet from an entirely different angle—namely, as
an! <font style="color:lightPINK">infrastructure that provides services to applications.</font>

1. Applications such as e-mail and Web surfing, Internet applications include mobile smartphone and tablet applications, including Internet messaging, mapping with real-time road-traffic information, music streaming movie and television streaming, online social media, video conferencing, multi-person games, and location-based recommendation systems. The applications are said to be <font style="color:lightblue">Distributed applications,</font> since they involve multiple end systems that exchange data with each other.

2. Internet applications run on end systems—they do not run in the packet switches in the network core, rather they facilitate the exchange of data among end systems.


<font style="color:lightpink">How does one program running on one end system instruct the Internet to deliver data to another program running on another end system?</font>

<font style="color:lightblue">- End systems attached to the Internet provide a socket interface that specifies
how a program running on one end system asks the Internet infrastructure to
deliver data to a specific destination program running on another end system.
</font>

<font style="color:lightblue">- This Internet socket interface is a set of rules (Protocols) that the sending program must follow so that the Internet can deliver the data to the destination program.</font>


<font style="color:yellow">Protocols:</font>
<font style="color:lightgreen">A protocol defines the format and the order of messages exchanged between two or more communicating entities, as well as the actions taken on the transmission and/or receipt of a message or other event.</font>

Here entities exchanging messages and taking actions are hardware or software components of some device.

All activity in the Internet that involves two or more communicating remote
entities is governed by a protocol. 

For example, 
<font style="color:lightblue">Hardware-implemented protocols</font> in two physically connected computers control the flow of bits on the “wire” between the two network interface cards; 

<font style="color:lightblue">Congestion-control protocols:</font> in end systems control the rate at which packets are transmitted between sender and receiver; 

<font style="color:lightblue">Protocols in routers:</font> determine a packet’s path from source to destination.
