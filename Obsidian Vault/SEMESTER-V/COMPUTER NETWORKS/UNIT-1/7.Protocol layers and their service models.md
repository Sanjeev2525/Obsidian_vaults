# Protocol layer :
A protocol layer can be implemented in software, in hardware, or in a combination of the two.

When taken together, the protocols of the various layers are called the <font style="color:lightblue">protocol stack.</font> The Internet protocol stack consists of five layers: the physical, link, network, transport, and application layers.

## Application Layer

- The application layer is where network applications and their application-layer protocols reside. 
- The Internet’s application layer includes many protocols, 
  - such as the <font style="color:pink">HTTP</font> protocol (which provides for Web document request and transfer), 
  - <font style="color:pink">SMTP</font> (which provides for the transfer of e-mail messages), 
  - <font style="color:pink">FTP</font> (which provides for the transfer of files between two end systems). 
  - We’ll see that certain network functions, such as the translation of human-friendly names for Internet end systems like www.ietf.org to a 32-bit network address, are also done with the help of a specific application-layer protocol, namely, the <font style="color:pink">domain name system (DNS)</font>. 
-  We’ll refer to this packet of information at the application layer as a <font style="color:lightblue">message</font>.

## Transport Layer:

- The Internet’s transport layer <font style="color:Bisque">transports application-layer messages between application endpoints</font>. 
- In the Internet, there are two transport protocols, 
	 - <font style="color:ORANGE">TCP</font> 
	 - <font style="color:ORANGE">UDP</font> 

either of which can transport application-layer messages. 

- TCP provides a <font style="color:coral">connection-oriented service</font> to its applications. This service includes guaranteed delivery of application-layer messages to the destination and flow control (that is, sender/receiver speed matching). TCP also breaks long messages into shorter segments and provides a congestion-control mechanism, so that a source throttles its transmission rate when the network is congested. 

- The UDP protocol provides a <font style="color:coral">connectionless service</font> to its applications. This is a no-frills service that provides no reliability, no flow control, and no congestion control. In this book, 

- We’ll refer to a transport-layer packet as a <font style="color:cornflowerblue">segment.</font>

## Network Layer:

- The Internet’s network layer is responsible for moving network-layer packets known as <font style="color:orange">datagrams</font> from one host to another. The Internet transport-layer protocol (TCP or UDP) in a source host passes a transport-layer segment and a destination address to the network layer, just as you would give the postal service a letter with a destination address. The network layer then provides the service of delivering the segment to the transport layer in the destination host. 
- The Internet’s network layer includes the celebrated IP protocol, which defines the fields in the datagram as well as how the end systems and routers act on these fields.

## Data Link Layer

- The Internet’s network layer routes a datagram through a series of routers between the source and destination. 

- To move a packet from one node (host or router) to the next node in the route, the network layer relies on the services of the link layer. 

- In particular, at each node, the network layer passes the datagram down to the link layer, which delivers the datagram to the next node along the route. At this next node, the link layer passes the datagram up to the network layer. 

- The services provided by the link layer depend on the specific link-layer protocol that is employed over the link. For example, some link-layer protocols provide reliable delivery, from transmitting node, over one link, to receiving node.  

- As datagrams typically need to traverse several links to travel from source to destination, a datagram may be handled by different link-layer protocols at different links along its route. For example, a datagram may be handled by Ethernet on one link and by PPP on the next link. The network layer will receive a different service from each of the different link-layer protocols. In this book, we’ll refer to the link-layer packets as <font style="color:orange">frames</font>.

---

## Physical Layer:

- While the job of the link layer is to move entire frames from one network element to an adjacent network element, the job of the physical layer is to move the individual bits within the frame from one node to the next. 

- The protocols in this layer are again link dependent and further depend on the actual transmission medium of the link (for example, twisted-pair copper wire, single-mode fiber optics). For example, Ethernet has many physical-layer protocols: one for twisted-pair copper wire, another for coaxial cable, another for fiber, and so on. In each case, a bit is moved across the link in a different way.

# Encapsulation:

Shows the physical path that data takes down a sending end system’s protocol stack, up and down the protocol stacks of an intervening link-layer switch and router, and then up the protocol stack at the receiving end system.

At the sending host, an application-layer message (M in Figure 1.24) is passed to the transport layer. 

In the simplest case, the transport layer takes the message and appends additional information (so-called transport-layer header information, Ht in Figure 1.24) that will be used by the receiver-side transport layer. 

The application-layer message and the transport-layer header information together constitute the transport-layer segment. The transport-layer segment thus encapsulates the application-layer message. The added information might include information allowing the receiver-side transport layer to deliver the message up to the appropriate application, and error-detection bits that allow the receiver to determine whether bits in the message have been changed in route. 

The transport layer then passes the segment to the network layer, which adds network-layer header information (Hn in Figure 1.24) such as source and destination end system addresses, creating a network-layer datagram. 

The datagram is then passed to the link layer, which (of course!) will add its own link-layer header information and create a link-layer frame. Thus, we see that at each layer, a packet has two types of fields: header fields and a payload field. The payload is typically a packet from the layer above.
