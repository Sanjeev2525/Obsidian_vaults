**HOME ACCESS :** 

1. <font style="color:lightPINK">DSL:</font>
- Today, the two most prevalent types of broadband residential access are
<font style="color:lightblue"> digital subscriber line (DSL)</font> and <font style="color:lightblue"> cable</font>
- A residence typically obtains DSL Internet access from the same local telephone company (telco) that provides its wired local phone access. Thus, when DSL is used, a customer’s telco is also its ISP. As shown in Figure 1.5, each customer’s DSL modem uses the existing telephone line exchange data with a <font style="color:lightblue"> digital subscriber line access multiplexer (DSLAM)</font> located in the telco’s local central office (CO). The home’s DSL modem takes digital data and translates it to high- frequency tones for transmission over telephone wires to the CO; the analog signals from many such houses are translated back into digital format at the DSLAM.

The residential telephone line carries both data and traditional telephone signals simultaneously, which are encoded at different frequencies:

• A high-speed downstream channel, in the 50 kHz to 1 MHz band
• A medium-speed upstream channel, in the 4 kHz to 50 kHz band
• An ordinary two-way telephone channel, in the 0 to 4 kHz band

This approach makes the single DSL link appear as if there were three separate links, so that a telephone call and an Internet connection can share the DSL link at the same time.  

- On the customer side, a splitter separates the data and telephone signals arriving to the home and forwards the data signal to the DSL modem. On the telco side, in the CO, the DSLAM separates the data and phone signals and sends the data into the Internet. Hundreds or even thousands of households connect to a single DSLAM.

- The DSL standards define multiple transmission rates, including downstream transmission rates of 24 Mbs and 52 Mbs, and upstream rates of 3.5 Mbps and 16! Mbps; the newest standard provides for aggregate upstream plus downstream rates of 1 Gbps [ITU 2014]. Because the downstream and upstream rates are different, the access is said to be <font style="color:lightblue"> asymmetric.</font>

2. <font style="color:lightpink">Cable :</font>
While DSL makes use of the telco’s existing local telephone infrastructure,
cable Internet access makes use of the cable television company’s existing cable television infrastructure. A residence obtains cable Internet access from the same company that provides its cable television.

- As illustrated in Figure 1.6, fiber optics connect the cable head end to neighborhood-level junctions, from which traditional coaxial cable is then used to reach individual houses and apartments. Each neighborhood junction typically supports 500 to 5,000 homes. Because both fiber and coaxial cable are employed in this system, it is often referred to as <font style="color:violet"> hybrid fiber coax (HFC).</font>

- Cable internet access requires special modems, called cable modems. As
with a DSL modem, the cable modem is typically an external device and connects to the home PC through an Ethernet port.  At the cable head end, the cable modem termination system (CMTS) serves a similar function as the DSL network’s DSLAM— turning the analog signal sent from the cable modems in many downstream homes back into digital format. Cable modems divide the HFC network into two channels, a downstream and an upstream channel. As with DSL, access is typically asymmetric, with the downstream channel typically allocated a higher transmission rate than the upstream channel. The DOCSIS 2.0 and 3.0 standards define downstream bitrates of 40 Mbps and 1.2 Gbps, and upstream rates of 30 Mbps and 100 Mbps, respectively. As in the case of DSL networks, the maximum achievable rate may not be realized due to lower contracted data rates or media impairments

- One important characteristic of cable Internet access is that it is a shared broadcast medium.

<font style="color:lightpink"> Fiber to the home (FTTH):</font>

Although DSL and cable networks currently represent the majority of residential broadband access in the United States, an up-and-coming technology that provides even higher speeds is fiber to the home (FTTH) [Fiber Broadband 2020]. 
As the name suggests, the FTTH concept is simple—provide an optical fiber path from the  CO(Central Office) directly to the home. FTTH can potentially provide Internet access rates in the gigabits per second range.

![[Pasted image 20220805184123.png]]

- There are several competing technologies for optical distribution from the CO to the homes. The simplest optical distribution network is called direct fiber, with one fiber leaving the CO for each home. More commonly, each fiber leaving the central office is actually shared by many homes; it is not until the fiber gets relatively close to the homes that it is split into individual customer-specific fibers.

- There are two competing optical-distribution network architectures that perform this splitting: 
-<font style="color:violet"> Active optical networks (AONs)</font> 
-<font style="color:violet"> Passive optical networks (PONs).</font>

- AON is essentially switched Ethernet, which is discussed in Chapter 6.
  Here, we briefly discuss PON, which is used in Verizon’s FiOS service.
  Figure 1.7 shows FTTH using the PON distribution architecture. Each home has an optical network terminator (ONT), which is connected by dedicated optical fiber to a neighborhood splitter. The splitter combines a number of homes (typically less than 100) onto a single, shared optical fiber, which connects to an optical line terminator (OLT) in the telco’s CO. The OLT, providing conversion between optical and electrical signals, connects to the Internet via a telco router. At home, users connect a home router (typically a wireless router) to the ONT and access the Internet via this home router. 

- In the PON architecture, all packets sent from OLT to the splitter are replicated at the splitter (similar to a cable head end).

<font style="color:lightpink">5G:</font>
5G fixed wireless is beginning to be deployed. 5G fixed wireless not only promises high-speed residential access, but will do so without installing costly and failure-prone cabling from the telco’s CO to the home. With 5G fixed wireless, using beam-forming technology, data is sent wirelessly from a provider’s base station to the a modem in the home.

A WiFi wireless router is connected to the modem (possibly bundled together), similar to how a WiFi wireless router is connected to a cable or DSL modem.

**Access in the Enterprise (and the Home): 
Ethernet and WiFi:**

![[Pasted image 20220805184925.png]]
<font style="color:lightpink">Ethernet:</font>
- On corporate and university campuses, and increasingly in home settings, a local area! network (LAN) is used to connect an end system to the edge router. Although there are many types of LAN technologies, Ethernet is by far the most prevalent access technology in corporate, university, and home networks. As shown in Figure 1.8, Ethernet users use twisted-pair copper wire to connect to an Ethernet switch, The Ethernet switch, or a network of such interconnected switches, is then in turn connected into the larger Internet. With Ethernet access, users typically have 100 Mbps to tens of Gbps access to the Ethernet switch, whereas servers may have 1 Gbps 10 Gbps access. 

<font style="color:lightpink">WiFi:</font>
- Increasingly, however, people are accessing the Internet wirelessly from laptops, smartphones, tablets, and other “things”. In a wireless LAN setting, wireless users transmit/receive packets to/from an access point that is connected into the enterprise’s network (most likely using wired Ethernet), which in turn is connected to the wired Internet. A wireless LAN user must typically be within a few tens of meters of the access point. Wireless LAN access based on IEEE 802.11 technology, more colloquially known as WiFi, is now just about everywhere—universities, business offices, cafes, airports, homes, and even in airplanes today provides a shared transmission rate of up to more than 100 Mbps.

<font style="color:lightPINK">LAN:</font>
Even though Ethernet and WiFi access networks were initially deployed in
enterprise (corporate, university) settings, they are also common components of home networks. Many homes combine broadband residential access (that is, cable modems or DSL) with these inexpensive wireless LAN technologies to create powerful home networks Figure 1.9 shows a typical home network. This home network consists of a roaming laptop, multiple Internet-connected home appliances, as well as a wired PC; a base station (the wireless access point), which communicates with the wireless PC and other wireless devices in the home; and a home router that connects the wireless access point, and any other wired home devices, to the Internet.

This network allows household members to have broadband access to the Internet with one member roaming from the kitchen to the backyard to the bedrooms.

<font style="color:lightPINK">Wide-Area Wireless Access: 3G and LTE 4G and 5G:</font>
- Mobile devices such as iPhones and Android devices are being used to message, share photos in social networks, make mobile payments, watch movies, stream music, and much more while on the run. These devices employ the same wireless infrastructure used for cellular telephony to send/receive packets through a base station that is operated by the cellular network provider. Unlike WiFi, a user need only be within a few tens of kilometers (as opposed to a few tens of meters) of the base station.

- Telecommunications companies have made enormous investments in so-called fourth-generation (4G) wireless, which provides real-world download speeds of up to 60 Mbps. But even higher-speed wide-area access technologies—a fifth-generation (5G) of wide-area wireless networks—are already being deployed.
