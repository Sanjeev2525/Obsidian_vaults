**Delay:**
Packet starts in a host (the source), passes through a series of routers, and ends its journey in another host (the destination). As a packet travels from one node (host or router) to the subsequent node (host or router) along this path, the packet suffers from several types of delays at each node along the path. 

The most important of these delays are the 
- Nodal processing delay 
- Queuing delay, 
- Transmission delay,
- Propagation delay; 
    
    together, these delays accumulate to give a <font style="color:lightblue"> total nodal delay.</font>

**Nodal Processing Delay :**
The time required to examine the packet’s header and determine where to direct the packet is part of the processing delay. The processing delay can also include other factors, such as the time needed to check for bit-level errors in the packet that occurred in transmitting the packet’s bits from the upstream node to router A.

**Queuing Delay:**
At the queue, the packet experiences a queuing delay as it waits to be transmitted onto the link. The length of the queuing delay of a specific packet will depend on the number of earlier-arriving packets that are queued and waiting for transmission onto the link. If the queue is empty and no other packet is currently being transmitted, then our packet’s queuing delay will be zero. On the other hand, if the traffic is heavy and many other packets are also waiting to be transmitted, the queuing delay will be long.

**Transmission Delay:**
Assuming that packets are transmitted in a first-come-first-served manner, as is common in packet-switched networks, our packet can be transmitted only after all the packets that have arrived before it have been transmitted.

Denote the length of the packet by L bits, and denote the transmission rate of the link from router A to router B by R bits/sec. 
 
For example, for a 10 Mbps Ethernet link, the rate is R = 10 Mbps; for a 100 Mbps Ethernet link, the rate is R = 100 Mbps. 

The transmission delay is  $$\frac{L}{R}.$$  This is the amount of time required to push (that is, transmit) all of the packet’s bits into the link. Transmission delays are typically on the order of microseconds to milliseconds in practice.


**Propagation Delay:**
Once a bit is pushed into the link, it needs to propagate to router B. The time required to propagate from the beginning of the link to router B is the <font style="color:lightblue">propagation delay. </font>

The bit propagates at the propagation speed of the link. The propagation speed depends on the physical medium of the link (i.e, fiber optics, twisted-pair copper wire, and so on) and is in the range of 

2 x10<sup>8</sup> meters/sec to 3 x 10<sup>8</sup> meters/sec 

which is equal to, or a little less than, the speed of light. The propagation delay is the distance between two routers divided by the propagation speed. 

That is, the propagation delay is 
$$\frac{d}{s}$$
 - where "d" is the distance between router A and router B and 
 - "s" is the propagation speed of the link.

the total nodal delay is given by 

$$d_{nodal}=d_{proc}+d_{queue}+d_{trans}+d_{prop}$$
