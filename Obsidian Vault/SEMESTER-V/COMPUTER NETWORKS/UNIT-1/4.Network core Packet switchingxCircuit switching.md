**THE NETWORK CORE:

Having examined the Internet’s edge, let us now delve more deeply inside the network core—the mesh of packet switches and links that interconnects the Internet’s end systems.

There are two fundamental approaches to moving data through a network of links and switches: 

- <font style="color:violet">Packet switching</font>
- <font style="color:violet">Circuit switching </font>

<font style="color:RED">Packet switching :</font> 
To send a message from a source end system to a destination end system, the source breaks long messages into smaller chunks of data known as <font style="color:lightblue"> packets</font>. 

Between source and destination, each packet travels through communication links and packet switches (for which there are two predominant types, routers and link-layer switches). 

Packets are transmitted over each communication link at a rate equal to the full transmission rate of the link. 

So, if a source end system or a packet switch is 
- Sending  a packet of <font style="color:lightblue"> L</font> bits 
- Over a link with transmission rate <font style="color:lightblue"> R</font> bits/sec, 
- Then the time to transmit the packet is <font style="color:lightblue"> L/R</font> seconds.

<font style="color:ORANGE"> Store-and-Forward Transmission:</font>

Most packet switches use store-and-forward transmission at the inputs to the links. Store-and-forward transmission means that the packet switch must receive the entire packet before it can begin to transmit the first bit of the packet onto the outbound link. 

![[Pasted image 20220808120140.png]]


To explore store-and-forward transmission in more detail, consider a simple network consisting of two end systems connected by a single router, as shown in Figure 1.11. 

A router will typically have many incident links, since its job is to switch an incoming packet onto an outgoing link; in this simple example, the router has the rather simple task of transferring a packet from one (input) link to the only other attached link. In this example, the source has three packets, each consisting of L bits, to send to the destination. At the snapshot of time shown in Figure 1.11, the source has transmitted some of packet 1, and the front of packet 1 has already arrived at the router. Because the router employs store-and-forwarding, at this instant of time, the router cannot transmit the bits it has received; instead it must first <font style="color:pink">buffer</font> (i.e., “store”) the packet’s bits. Only after the router has received all of the packet’s bits can it begin to transmit (i.e., “forward”) the packet onto the outbound link. 


To gain some insight into store-and-forward transmission, 

Let’s now calculate the amount of time that elapses from when the source begins to send the packet until the destination has received the entire packet. ( Ignoring propagation delay—the time it takes for the bits to travel across the wire at near the speed of light.)``

The source begins to transmit at time 0; 
		At time L/R seconds, the source has transmitted the entire packet, and the entire packet has been received and stored at the router (since there is no propagation delay). 
		At time L/R seconds, since the router has just received the entire packet, it can begin to transmit the packet onto the outbound link towards the destination; at time 2L/R, the router has transmitted the entire packet, and the entire packet has been received by the destination. Thus, the total delay is 2L/R.

If the switch instead forwarded bits as soon as they arrive (without first receiving the entire packet), then the total delay would be L/R since bits are not held up at the router. But, as we will discuss in Section 1.4, routers need to receive, store, and process the entire packet before forwarding. 

Now let’s calculate the amount of time that elapses from when the source begins to send the first packet until the destination has received all three packets. 

As before, at time L/R, the router begins to forward the first packet. But also at time L/R the source will begin to send the second packet, since it has just finished sending the entire first packet. Thus, at time 2L/R, the destination has received the first packet and the router has received the second packet. Similarly, at time 3L/R, the destination has received the first two packets and the router has received the third packet. Finally, at time 4L/R the destination has received all three packets! 

Let’s now consider the general case of sending one packet from source to destination over a path consisting of N links each of rate R (thus, there are N-1 routers between source and destination). Applying the same logic as above, we see that the end-to-end delay is: 

   $$d_{end-to-end} =N\frac{L}{R}$$ ---

<font style="color:ORANGE"> Queuing Delays and Packet Loss:</font>

Each packet switch has multiple links attached to it. For each attached link, the packet switch has an output buffer (also called an output queue), which stores packets that the router is about to send into that link.

![[Pasted image 20220808130438.png]]

The output buffers play a key role in packet switching. If an arriving packet needs to be transmitted onto a link but finds the link busy with the transmission of another packet, the arriving packet must wait in the output buffer. Thus, in addition to the store-and-forward delays, packets suffer output buffer queuing delays. These delays are variable and depend on the level of congestion in the network. Since the amount of buffer space is finite, an arriving packet may find that the buffer is completely full with other packets waiting for transmission. In this case, <font style="color:lightblue">packet loss</font> will occur—either the arriving packet or one of the already-queued packets will be dropped.

<font style="color:orange">Forwarding Tables and Routing Protocols :</font>

But how does the router determine which link it should forward the packet onto?

Packet forwarding is actually done in different ways in different types of computer networks.

In the Internet, every end system has an address called an IP address. When a source end system wants to send a packet to a destination end system, the source includes the destination’s IP address in the packet’s header. As with postal addresses, this address has a hierarchical structure. When a packet arrives at a router in the network, the router examines a portion of the packet’s destination address and forwards the packet to an adjacent router. More specifically, each router has a <font style="color:lightblue">forwarding table</font> that maps destination addresses (or portions of the destination addresses) to that router’s outbound links. When a packet arrives at a router, the router examines the address and searches its forwarding table, using this destination address, to find the appropriate outbound link. The router then directs the packet to this outbound link

We just learned that a router uses a packet’s destination address to index a forwarding table and determine the appropriate outbound link. 

<font style="color:cyan">But this statement begs yet another question: How do forwarding tables get set?</font>

The Internet has a number of special routing protocols that are used to automatically set the forwarding tables. A routing protocol may, for example, determine the shortest path from each router to each destination and use the shortest path results to configure the forwarding tables in the routers.

**Circuit Switching 

In circuit-switched networks, the resources needed along a path (buffers, link transmission rate) to provide for communication between the end systems are <font style="color:lightpink">reserved </font>for the duration of the communication session between the end systems. In packet-switched networks, these resources are not reserved; a session’s messages use the resources on demand and, as a consequence, may have to wait (that is, queue) for access to a communication link.
