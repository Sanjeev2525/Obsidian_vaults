![[Pasted image 20220921203934.png]]

---
#### 6.Types of Boilers :

##### i.Firetube boiler

![[Pasted image 20220921204559.png]]

- Fire in tube or Hot gas through tubes and boiler feed water in shell side
- Fire Tubes submerged in water 

Application 

- Used for small steam capacities ( upto 25T/hr and 17.5kg/cm2 

Merits
- Low Capital Cost and fuel Efficient (82%) 
- Accepts wide & load fluctuations 
- Steam pressure variation is less (Large volume of water) 
- Packaged Boiler

---

##### ii.Water tube boiler

![[Pasted image 20220921204825.png]]

- Water flow through tubes 
- Water Tubes surrounded by hot gas 

Application 
- Used for Power Plants
- Steam capacities range from 4.5- 120 t/hr 

Characteristics 
- High Capital Cost 
- Used for high pressure high capacity steam boiler
- Demands more controls
- Calls for very stringent water quality

---
##### iii.Packaged Boiler 
![[Pasted image 20220921205055.png]]

- Package boilers are generally of shell type with fire tube design 
- High heat release rate in small combustion space
- More number of passes-so more heat transfer
- Large number of small diameter tubes leading to good convective heat transfer. 
- Higher thermal efficiency

---
##### iv.Chain Grate or Travelling Grate Stoker Boiler

![[Pasted image 20220921205246.png]]

- Coal is fed on one end of a moving steel chain grate 
- Coal burns and ash drops off at end
- Coal grate controls rate of coal feed into furnace by controlling the thickness of the fuel bed.
- Coal must be uniform in size as large lumps will not burn out completely
- Bed thickness decreases from coal feed end to rear end and so more air at front and less air at rear end to be supplied
- Water tube boiler

---
##### v. Spreader Stoker Boiler 

- Uses both suspension and grate burning
- Coal fed continuously over burning coal bed
- Coal fines burn in suspension and larger coal pieces burn on grate
- Good flexibility to meet changing load requirements
- Preferred over other type of stokers in industrial application
---
##### vi. Pulverized Fuel Burner

![[Pasted image 20220921205650.png]]

- Coal is pulverized to a fine powder, so that less than 2% is +300 microns, and 70-75% is below 75 microns. 
- Coal is blown with part of the combustion air into the boiler plant through a series of burner nozzles. 
- Combustion takes place at temperatures from 1300-1700°C 
- Particle residence time in the boiler is typically 2-5 seconds 
- One of the most popular system for firing pulverized coal is the tangential firing using four burners corner to corner to create a fire ball at the center of the furnace. See Figure

<font style="color:cornflowerblue">Advantages </font>
- Its ability to burn all ranks of coal from anthracitic to lignite, and it permits combination firing (i.e., can use coal, oil and gas in same burner). Because of these advantages, there is widespread use of pulverized coal furnaces. 

<font style="color:cornflowerblue">Disadvantages </font>
- High power demand for pulverizing
- Requires more maintenance, fly ash erosion and pollution complicate unit operation
---
##### vii. Fluidized bed Combustion (FBC) boiler

![[Pasted image 20220921205950.png]]

- When an evenly distributed air or gas is passed upward through a finely divided bed of solid particles such as sand supported on a fine mesh, the particles are undisturbed at low velocity. As air velocity is gradually increased, a stage is reached when the individual particles are suspended in the air stream.
- Further, increase in velocity gives rise to bubble formation, vigorous turbulence and rapid mixing and the bed is said to be fluidized. Coal is fed continuously in to a hot air agitated refractory sand bed, the coal will burn rapidly and the bed attains a uniform temperature

Advantages :

- Higher rates of heat transfer between combustion process and boiler tubes (thus reduced furnace area and size required),
- Combustion temperature $850^{o}$ C is lower than in a conventional furnace. The lower furnace temperatures means reduced NO x production.
- In addition, the limestone (CaCO3 ) and dolomite (MgCO3 ) react with SO2 to form calcium and magnesium sulfides, respectively, solids which do not escape up the stack; This means the plant can easily use high sulfur coal.

Fuel Flexibility: Multi fuel firing

#### 7. Step By Step Approach for Maximum Demand Control

1. Load Curve Generation 
2. Rescheduling of Loads
3. Storage of products/in process material/process utilities like refrigeration
4. Shedding of non essential loads
5. Operation of Captive power generation
6. Reactive power compensation

##### 1. Load Curve Generation

- Presenting the <font style="color:cornflowerblue">load demand</font> of a consumer <font style="color:cornflowerblue">against time of the day</font> is known as a ‘load curve’.
- If it is plotted for the 24 hours of a single day, it is known as a ‘hourly load curve’ and if daily demands plotted over a month, it is called ‘daily load curve’.
- A typical hourly load curve for an engineering industry

##### 2.Rescheduling of Loads

- Rescheduling of large electric loads and equipment operations, in different shifts can be planned and implemented <font style="color:cornflowerblue">to minimize the simultaneous maximum demand.</font> 
- For this purpose, it is advisable to <font style="color:cornflowerblue">prepare an operation flow chart and a process chart</font>
- Analyzing these charts and with an integrated approach, it would be <font style="color:cornflowerblue">possible to reschedule the operations</font> and running equipment in such a way as to improve the load factor which in turn reduces the maximum demand.

##### 3. Storage of Products/in process material/ process utilities like refrigeration 

- It is possible to reduce the maximum demand by <font style="color:cornflowerblue">building up storage capacity of products</font>/ materials, water, chilled water / hot water, using electricity <font style="color:cornflowerblue">during off peak periods.</font>
- <font style="color:cornflowerblue">Off peak hour operations</font> also help to save energy due to favorable conditions such as lower ambient temperature etc.
- Example: <font style="color:#FF2400">Ice bank system</font> is used in milk & dairy industry. Ice is made in lean period and used in peak load period and thus maximum demand is reduced.

##### 4.Shedding of Non-Essential Loads

- When the maximum demand tends to reach preset limit, <font style="color:cornflowerblue">shedding some of non-essential loads temporarily</font> can help to reduce it. It is possible to install direct demand monitoring systems, which will switch off non-essential loads when a preset demand is reached. Simple systems give an alarm, and the loads are shed manually. 

- Sophisticated microprocessor controlled systems are also available, which provide a wide variety of control options like: 
	- Accurate prediction of demand
	- Graphical display of present load, available load, demand limit
	- Visual and audible alarm
	- Automatic load shedding in a predetermined sequence 
	- Automatic restoration of load
	- Recording and metering
---
##### 5.Operation of Captive Generation and Diesel Generation Sets

- When diesel generation sets are used to supplement the power supplied by the electric utilities, it is advisable to <font style="color:cornflowerblue">connect the D.G. sets for durations when demand reaches the peak value</font>. This would reduce the load demand to a considerable extent and minimize the demand charges. 

##### 6.Reactive Power Compensation
- The maximum demand can also be reduced at the plant level by <font style="color:cornflowerblue">using capacitor banks and maintaining the optimum power factor</font>. Capacitor banks are available with microprocessor based control systems. These systems switch on and off the capacitor banks to maintain the desired Power factor of system and optimize maximum demand thereby.

#### 9. Boiler Efficiency calculation

##### i) Direct method

$$\frac{Heat Output}{Heat Input} X 100$$

$$\eta(efficiency)=\frac{Q\times(h_{g}-h_f)}{q\times GCV}$$

---
##### ii) Indirect method 

1. Theoretical Air Requirement
$$\frac{(11.6 \times C)+[(34.8\times(\frac{(H_{2}-O_2)}{8})]+(4.35\times S)}{100} kg/kg$$

2. Excess Air Supplied :

$$\frac{O_{2}}{21-O_2}\times100$$

3. Actual mass of air supplied:

$$ \frac{1+EA}{100}\times theoretical airrequiremnt$$

4. Estimation of all losses :

i) Dry flu gas loss

Percentage of heat loss due to dry flu
$$\frac{m\times c_{p}\times(t_f-t_a)\times100}{GCV (fuel)}$$
here ,
$$m=AAC + 1$$
ii) Loss due to evaporation

$$\frac{9\times h_{2}\times (584+c_p\times(t_f-t_a))}{GCV(fuel)}\times 100$$
iii)Loss due to moisture present in fuel

$$\frac{M \times (584+ C_{p}\times(t_f-t_a))}{GCV(fuel)}$$


iv) Loss due to moisture present in air

$$\frac{AAS \times humidity\times C_{p}\times(t_f-t_a)}{GCV(fuel)}$$

v)Loss due to unburnt in flyash

$$\frac{\frac{Total ashcollected}{kgof fuelburnt}\times GCV(flyash)\times100}{GCV(fuel)}$$

vi) Loss due to unburnt in bottomash

$$\frac{\frac{Total ashcollected}{kgof fuelburnt}\times GCV(bottomash)\times100}{GCV(fuel)}$$

vii) Loss due to  radiation and other unaccounted loss

For a small boiler it is estimated to be 2%

**Boiler Efficiency**

$$Efficiency(\eta)=100-(i+ii+iii+iv+v+vi+vii)$$
